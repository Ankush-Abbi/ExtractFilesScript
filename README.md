# ExtractFilesScript
Extract all files from all the folders at a location and remove all the folders

This script is written to have the files from the all existing folders irrespective of the extension of the file. The folders will be deleted after the excusion of the script and to avoid the conflict between the names the filename is replaced with the folder name concatenated with a counter. 
The effort was to have all files at one place rather than reaching the files by going into the each folder.
